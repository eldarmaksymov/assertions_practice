# Practice and Learn: Audit Procedures and Assertions Match

This widget helps you strengthen your understanding of how specific **audit procedures** are designed to test particular **management assertions**. Drag and drop each procedure into the correct assertion-category square—if you're right, the square will turn green and the procedure will disappear from the list. It’s a hands-on way to master how audit procedures align with assertions for transactions, balances, and disclosures.
